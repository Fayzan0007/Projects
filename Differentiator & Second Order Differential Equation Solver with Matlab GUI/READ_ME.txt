
Application features : 
1.It can differentiate any function 

2.It can solve differential equation upto second order

3.The graphs can be erased individually by clicking "clear" buttons beside them or all of them can be erased at once by clicking the "Clear all" button.

4.It can open simulation for the user to use.

Limitations :
1. Second order equations can not be solved using Euler's Method


Note :
1. As a built in function was used in "ODE Solver" part of this app,it may not show ouput,please run the .m file to fully judge it.
